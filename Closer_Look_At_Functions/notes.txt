Passing primitive value as argument will not change original value but non-primitive as argument original values will be changed
(consider passing arguments as coping data.)

Making same method for two object is bad so declare function outside and call it using call,bind,apply mehtod to use this.

In call method first argument is object(this) we want to set and after that pass arguments.
In apply method first arguments is object(this) and other arguments should be passed in array.
Bind function will return new function with this attached and we can also created method for particlular argument by passing them when creating find function.

IIFE are earlier created for creating variable as var are function scoped but now they are not used much because let and const are block scope.
