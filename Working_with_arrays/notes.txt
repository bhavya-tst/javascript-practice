slice:- will not include ending index.will return new changed array.
splice:- will change in original array.First argument is index to remove element and second argument is no of elements to remove.
reverse:- Mutate the original array.
sort:- Mutate the original array.
Concat:- Does not mutate the original array.
join- join all elements with character passed.

forEach:- we get current element,index and array in each iteration of forEach.Break and continue will not work in forEach.
          In map it will return value,key and map.
          In set it will return value,key and map but in set there is no key or index so key will be equal to value.

map:- Return new array.
filter:- Filter out values and return new array.
Reduce:- Reduce array to single value(adding).Each iterations has acc,current,index and array.
         Pass intital value of acc after functions and return new value in each iterations. 

some and every:- Includes only check for equality but some can check for condition same with every but will return true only if every element statisfy condition.

flat:- defalut will flat 1 depth of array and for more depth pass in function eg. falt(depth).
flatmap:- combines both map and flat map but has only depth of 1.
